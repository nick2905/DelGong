One day, all he could do was to paddle the water to keep it from freezing around him, and trapping him in the lake. “I am so tired!” he said, paddling with all his might.  The ice got thicker and drew closer to him. In a moment, two giant hands swept him up.  “You poor thing!” said a farmer. He held the Ugly Duckling close to his thick wool jacket and took the bird to his home.   Never was a warm fireplace more welcome!  For the rest of the winter, the farmer cared for the Ugly Duckling.  Then spring came. Tips of green covered the trees. Short, bright flowers popped up from the ground.   “It is time for you to go to the lake to swim again, as you were born to do,” said the farmer.  He took the duckling back to the lake where he had found him, and set him with care on the water. “Gosh, I feel strong,” said the young bird, flapping his wings.  “Why, I never felt as strong as I do right now!”",

Clunk!\"   It took her two days to nail her house of wood together.  Patty finished, looked at her house and thought, \"well..., it's a little wobbly and maybe it isn't my VERY best job...

No one ever came to visit and, thus, the woman took to caring for her garden of beautiful flowers.  Eventually not even the old woman’s garden could keep her from feeling lonesome. One day, as the old woman was watering her bright red roses, a witch came walking up the hill to the woman’s house.  The old woman was skeptical of witches because she’d heard about all the apples and beans they tried to sell; however, this witch seemed nicer than what the old woman imagined.  They talked for a long time, and each grew fond of the other.  The woman finally told the witch that she had grown lonely in her old age.
